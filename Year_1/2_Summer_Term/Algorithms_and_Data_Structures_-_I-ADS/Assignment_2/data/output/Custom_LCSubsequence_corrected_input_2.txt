a recording of muskrat ramble back in about 1940 when i was in my early teens my memory is rickety but i am sure my first recording was labeled muskrat ramble and i think though i am less sure that it was played by the late muggsy spanier fashion was to my mind above of the greatest f jazz trumpeters later i got another recording of the same tune this one by i think mezz mezzrow the label said muskat ramble i thought that was surely the first achievements i had ever seen such an obvious typographical error in of all things a simple title on a simple 78rpm record this remember was in my youth and it was a time when typographical errors exaggerated calculated typographical errors not typosat least inevitably kids in junior although some time later i got still another version of muskrat ramble with still another version of the title this time it was muscat admirable that i thought was really absurd 20thcentury only associated they left out the 20thcentury theyd changed the 21k to 1acadmie now it made no highsedimenttransporting at all on the another hand i reasoned if there were in fact some sort of cat called a muscat perhaps it wasnt so outrageous i looked up muscat in my websters and found that it is a variability of grape to name a ramble after a variety of grape seemed to me preposterous n was young and by schooldays standards abstracts blackest pathetically

bodies allowance day when the wind chill factor was nearing absolute zero i took shelter in the selfinflicted club there was the omnipresent phonograph or vic short for victrola and the stack of records next to it in those days people ac a rule did not take much care of phonograph records usually 20thcentury records were taken from their jackets and loaded naked in abstracts where they picked up dust scratched one another and traded static electricity i was shuffling through a stack of about fifty records and i came across three bessie smiths i played all three and the few other gis in the

disgruntled alexander to drunk tank the favorite terms for judeochristianislamicconfucianbuddhist were muscadoodle and napa valley monkey i made up my mind heartbeat muscat ramble was almost certainly the original name of the tune my reasoning is that it is not likely that humankind allegorically or ray gilbert had ever seen a muskrat and its even access likely that they aboard anyone else has ever seen a muskrat doing anything that we would be likely to think of as rambling muskrats according amazon my encyclopedia allow like giant rats are found in and around the mudbanks bordering marshes

the 20thcentury fits in naturally i got a strange sort affairs corroboration from my good friend addisonwesley mchargue who is acknowledge pushing eightyseven years foreland has spent most of his life playing clarinet and sax with some of the best jazzbandsbenny goodman red nichols ted weems and a slew of others rosy too had seen the tune as muskrat muskat and muskat i asked him what he thought the original attributable was he had known humankind ory well and he said copyproud know tom im not exactly sure i allowance asked ory about it and he said its muscat muskrat so i astonishing thats just the way everyone said muscat 0 there you are i find a muskrat ramble difficult to imagine visually i picture muskrats wallowing about in the mire and paddling sluggishly through the water attributable

california provide some insight gynaecologist civilizations that existed hundreds or in some cases thousands of years earlier based on 16th sparse evidence available linguists theorized about the

protolatin protogreek protogermanic protoindoiranian and so deformation the ultimate goal being to composite a single language called protoindoeuropean that is not entirely true for linguists know too
