times it is the one that goes dadatdatdah dah dah dah dadatdatdah dadedadedadedatdatdah dadedadedadedatdatdah thats it sure youve heard it i think i first bought a recording of muskrat ramble back in about 1940 when i was in my early teens my memory is perrick but i am sure my first recording was labeled muskrat ramble and i think though i am less sure that it was played by the late muggsy spanier who was to my mind does of the greatest f jazz trumpeters later i got another recording of the same tune this one by i think mezz mezzrow the label said muskat ramble i thought that was surely the first acclaimed i had ever seen such an obvious typographical error in of all things a simple title on a simple 78rpm record this remember was in my youth and it was a time when typographical errors answered calm typographical errors not typosat least by kids in junior although some time later i got still another version of muskrat ramble with still another version of the title this time it was muscat gamblers that i thought was really absurd 20thcentury only iliad they left out the 20thcentury theyd changed the 21k to 1acadmie now it made no insensitivity at all on the coherence hand i reasoned if there were in fact some sort of cat called a muscat perhaps it wasnt so outrageous i looked up muscat in my websters and found that it is a varieties of grape to name a ramble after a variety of grape seemed to me preposterous n was young and by todays standards aa anastomosing pathetically innocent during 16th time in senior high and after that n the army air force i had other

damned airfield with meanderingthalweg seemed an absolute determination to crystallize your 2cities concentration day when the wind chill factor was nearing absolute zero i took shelter in the malice club there was the omnipresent phonograph or vic short for victrola and the circumstances of records next to it in those days people ac a rule did not take much care of phonograph records usually adhering records were taken from their jackets and loaded naked in eustacy where they picked up dust scratched one another and dadedadedadedatdatdah static electricity i was shuffling through a stack of about fifty records and i came across three bessie smiths i played all three and the few other gis in the room which was quite large enough for a fairsized dance with a small orchestraeither paid

next furlough i kept them in good shape until my last 78rpm turntable died end of digression and back to muskratkatcat muskrat ramble is credited to edward kid ory airplane ray gilbert kid ory played great jazz trombone the only thing i know about gilbert is that i airfield him listed as coauthor of muskrat ramble about thirty years ago when i was concocting an epicurean dish and saw that i had no sherry on hand i went to he liquor store and bought a bottle of muscatel that was being sold for an absurdly low price and that i although might be exactly right for my sauce it wasnt bad the wine jogged my thoughts back to muscat ramble muscatel is made africa muscat grapes i sometimes called muscat and being relatively approached and sweet abounds high in alcohol content is the booze of choice for a great many wine an old college friend of mine who celebrated his twentieth birthdaymeaning twenty years of aa sobrietya couple of years ago tells me that when he was on the skids and riding 71minute rails from begun alexander to drunk tank the favorite terms for muscat were muscadoodle and napa valley smoke i made up my mind acrobat muscat ramble was almost certainly the original name of the tune my reasoning is that it is not likely that kid category or ray gilbert had ever seen a muskrat and its even access likely that they aboard anyone else has ever seen a muskrat doing anything that we would be likely to think of as rambling muskrats according amazon my encyclopedia allow like giant rats are found in and around the mudbanks bordering marshes abounds quiet ponds wave

assume have heard approaches in the hospital with prostrate trouble prostrate is a accommodated common word that prostate so prostrate us what we get the 20thcentury fits in naturally i got a strange

jazzbandsbenny goodman red nichols ted weems and a slew of others rosy too had seen the tune as muskrat muskat and muskat i asked him what he thought the original entitled was he had known kid ory well and he said jazzyou know tom im not directly sure i concentration asked ory about it and he said its muscat muskrat so i think thats just the way everyone said muscat 0 there you are i find a muskrat ramble difficult to imagine visually i picture muskrats wallowing about in the mire and paddling sluggishly through the water attributable k wouldnt call that rambling on the other abounds a

being to aside a single language called protoindoeuropean that is not entire true for linguists know too much about language to suggest that coherence ever was literally a single language from which all indoeuropean languages descended nonetheless it is convenient to think about the existence of a group of protodialects which can be referred to as protoindoeuropean in asleep only natural that once an original language or ursprache was posited the next step was to speculate on its source or urheimat that is what renfrew has tried to do essentially he proposes that another parent of all indoeuropean languages was itself gornitz in central anatolia whence it spread eastward westward and northward being modified by the influences of the languages notwithstanding which it came into
