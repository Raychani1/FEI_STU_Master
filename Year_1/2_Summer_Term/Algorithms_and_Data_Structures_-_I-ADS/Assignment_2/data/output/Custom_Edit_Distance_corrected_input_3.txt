deformation and river response before specific examples of syntectonic impacts on alluvial rivers can be discussed a brief review of types of tectonic activity types of rivers and river response will be presented this background material sets the stage for detailed discussions that follow types of deformation the surficial movements in an alluvial valley can take different forms as illustrated in figure 21 the displacement can be seismic and associated with earthquakes and abrupt faulting or it can be aseismic with progressive tilting and warping of the valley floor faults may b lateral faults that displace or offset the channel figure 21a without vertical displacement this type of displacement should be easily recognized faults with vertical displacement may have ate uplifted block upstream of the fault with the result that gradient is steepened figure 21b in the opposite case the gradient will be decreased figure 21c the effect will resemble monoclinal tilting figure 21f g pairs of faults may produce uplifted horst or downdropped blocks graben that will both steepen and reduce gradient figure 21d e this has the same effect as domes and anticlines or basins and synclines figure 21h i in addition to all of these structural features the entire valley may be tilted upstream or downstream or the tilting may be across the valley toward either side of the floodplain figure 21j k l the possibilities are great but in reality the result will be local steepening or reduction of gradient or crossvalley tilting streams respond to vertical displacement along faults figure 21b and c by aggradation or degradation when the displacement produces a channel segment steeper than the original stream gradient figure 21b erosion will be initiated in this reach when the displacement produces a channel segment of lower elevation or gradient than the original stream figure 21c aggradation will occur even all displacements may be sufficient 0 induce aggradation or degradation 0 large streams if the displacement forms a dam figure 21c the stream will be blocked and it will flow along the fault or form a lake wallace 1968 mentioned that even a few inches of vertical upthrow along the downstream side of a fault can produce a dam across a small stream which can divert its course bull figure 21 surface deformation by faulting folding and lateral tilting plan view on left crosssection on right from ouchi 1983 small arrows indicate direction of flow large arrows indicate direction of movement the displacement in each case is greatly exaggerated horst and graben figure 21d and be combine two different types be vertical displacement figure 21b and c there will be aggradation upstream from the horst and degradation which will migrate upstream on the downstream part of the horst reduced sediment supply because of aggradation upstream will enhance the downstream degradation upstream of the graben there will be degradation an aggradation in the graben itself a river in such a location will be unstable as cartier and alt 1982 suggested for the bitterroot river in montana the type of folding figure 21 will affect a river similar to the various types of faulting but changes will probably be less abrupt the effects of tilting will depend upon the amount but in the simplest as steepening of a valley will cause degradation figure 21k and a reverse tilt figure 21l will cause deposition lateral tilting will cause channel shift downdip figure 21j or avulsion figure 2 shows only simple but exaggerated cases whereas actual displacements can be more complicated for example faults can take any angle from parallel to perpendicular to river flow direction fault displacements of the surface at the time of an earthquake are obvious and its influence on alluvial rivers can be observed for example small stream channels have been offset by strikeslip movement figures 18 21a of the san andreas fault wallace 1968 pointed out that the offset of a stream channel depends on the relative rates of fluvial and tectonic processes the main reason why channel offset caused by the san andreas fault is clear is the extremely high rate of displacement along the fault 203 mmyear brown and wallace 1968 and the relatively small size of streams crossing and flowing along the fault while fault displacements are obvious movements f the land surface by folding can be slow however this type of deformation can also be an important influence on river behavior for example concentration of erosion along only one river bank can be the result of lateral tilt jefferson 1907 nanson 1980a leeder and alexander 1907 types of alluvial rivers it is apparent that different types of alluvial channels will respond differently to deformation therefore their characteristics must be reviewed before their response can b evaluated this can best e done by discussing a simple classification of alluvial channels that is based on type of sediment load and pattern five basic channel patterns exist figure 22 1 straight channels with either migrating sand waves or 2 with migrating alternate bars forming a sinuous thalweg 3 two types of meandering channels a highly sinuous channel of equal width pattern 3a and channels that are wide at bends than in crossings pattern 3b 4 the meanderingbraided transition and 5 a typical braided stream the relative stability of these channels in terms of their normal erosional activity and the shape and gradient of the channels as related to relative sediment size load velocity of flow and stream power are also indicated in figure 22 it has been possible to develop these patterns experimentally by varying he gradient sediment load stream power and the type of sediment load transported by the channel schumm and kahn 1972 therefore alluvial channels have also been classified according to the type of sediment load moving through the channels as suspendedload mixedload and bedload channels figure 22 water discharge determines the dimensions of the channel width depth meander dimensions but the relative proportions of bed load sand and gravel and suspended load silts and clays determine not only the shape of the channel but widthdepth ratio and channel pattern a suspendedload channel has been defined as one that transports less than 3 percent bed load and a bedload channel as one transporting more than 11 percent bed load schumm 1977 the mixedload channel lies between these two figure 12 null figure 22 channel classification based on pattern and type of sediment load with associated variables and relative stability indicated schumm 1981 alluvial rivers that transport clay silt sand and gravel can be placed within these three general categories however within the meanderingstream group there is considerable range of sinuosity 125 to 30 in addition in the braidedstream category there are barbraided and islandbraided channels islands are vegetated bars figure 22 suggests that the range of channels from straight to braided forms a continuum but experimental work ad field studies have indicated that the changes of pattern between braided meandering and straight occur relatively abruptly at riverpattern thresholds figure 23 the pattern changes take place at critical values of stream power gradient and sediment load schumm and kahn 1972 null figure 23 relation between flume slope and sinuosity during experiments at constant water discharge sediment load stream power velocity increase with flume slope and a similar relation can be developed with these variables from schumm and khan 1972 although the five patterns of figure 22 involve all three river types there are five basic bedload channel patterns figure 24a that have been recognized during experimental studies of channel patterns schumm 1977 p 158 these five basic bedload channel patterns can be extended to mixedload and suspendedload channels to produce 13 river patterns figure 24 patterns 15 are bedload channel patterns patterns 610 are mixedload channel patterns and patterns 1113 are suspendedload channel patterns figure 24 attempts to show sinuosity differences and how the pattern thresholds change with increasing valley slope stream power and sediment load for each channel type the three major river types are controlled by type of sediment load but within each type the different patterns reflect increased valley slope sediment load and stream power the different bedload channel patterns figure 24 can be described as follows pattern 1 straight essentially equalwidth channel with migrating sand waves pattern 2 alternatebar channel with migrating side 0 alternate bars and a slightly sinuous thalweg pattern 3 lowsinuosity meandering channel with large alternate bars that develop chutes pattern 4 transitional meanderingthalweg braided channel the large alternate bars or point bars have been dissected by chutes but a meandering thalweg can be identified pattern 5 is a typical barbraided channel as compared to the bedload channels the five mixedload channels figure 24b are relatively narrower and deeper and there is greater ban stability the higher degree of bank stability permits the maintenance of narrow deep straight channels pattern 6 and alternate bars stabilize because of the finer sediments to form slightly sinuous channels pattern 7 pattern 8 is a truly meandering channel wide on the bends relatively narrow at the crossings and subject 0 chute cutoffs pattern 9 maintains the sinuosity of a meandering channel but with a greater sediment transport the presence of bars gives it a composite sinuousbraided appearance pattern 10 is a braided channel that is relatively more stable than that of bedload channel 5 and it is likely to b islandbraided null figure 24 the range of alluvial channel patterns for the three channel types a bedload channel patterns b mixedload channel patterns c suspendedload channel patterns from schumm 1981 suspendedload channels figure 24c are narrow and deeper than mixedload channels suspended load pattern 11 is a straight narrow deep channel with only small quantities of bed load this type f channel may have the highest sinuosity of all patterns 12 and 3 rivers may undergo a metamorphosis during which the channel morphology changes completely that is a suspendedload channel pattern 12 could become braided pattern 5 bar a braided channel pattern 5 could become meandering pattern 8 or 12 etc when there is a sufficiently great change in the type of sediment load transported through that channel therefore the change from one type of channel pattern to another may be relatively common as the nature of the sediment moved through the system changes and this may be the effect of tributary sediment contributions or upstream degradation or aggradation or tectonics there is an additional channel pattern that spans the range of stream types of figure 24 this is the anastomosing pattern of branching and rejoining channel segments schumm et al 1996 the channel segments can be straight meandering or braided and they appear to span he range of channel types anastomosing or anabranching channels differ from braided channels because they are composed of multiple channels that are separated by a floodplain figure 25 whereas braided channels have multiple thalwegs in a single channel knighton and nanson 1993 and richards et al 1993 suggest that gis pattern is transitioned to a single channel because anastomosing rivers appear to be associated with partly blocked valleys smith and smith 1980 and tectonic uplift gregory and schumm 1987 reduced gradient from whatever cause appears to be important and therefore anastomosing reaches of a river can be evidence of tectonic activity evidence of deformation the first geomorphic clues of active tectonics may be tectonic landforms that result from longcontinued deformation such as modified drainage networks and deformed sets of terraces these obvious features are in contrast to the more subtle changes of alluvial rivers drainage networks the arrangement of streams and tributaries into a drainage network is affected by the regional slope of the surface on which the pattern develops climate and the erodibility of the surface material local variations in both slope and materials will cause variations in the drainage pattern figure 12 for example experimental studies demonstrated that parallel drainage patterns form on slopes greater than about 25 percent whereas dendritic patterns form on gentler slopes phillips and schumm 1987 null figure 25 map of anastomosing channels of ovens and king rivers numbers indicate relative ages of channels and reaches of channels from youngest 1 to oldest 4 from schumm et al 1996 local variations in regional surface slope can cause anomalous drainage patterns a topographic high caused by active uplift will cause a deflection of portions of the drainage pattern for instance on the upslope side of an uplift the local surface slope will be opposite that of the regional slope this can cause portions of the drainage pattern to develop in a direction opposite to that of the drainage network an uplift may also deflect portions of the drainage from the general direction of the regional slope figure 26 as the major streams are deflected away from the uplift tributaries on one side will be lengthened and those on the other side will be shortened changes of an entire drainage network as 3a result of tilting are described by sparling 1967 who notes that isostatic adjustment in ottawa county ohio has increased the gradient of some streams and decreased the gradient of others incision of the steepened streams permitted them to capture the streams that were aggrading as a result of reduced gradient russell 1939 described various drainage paters found an the flat alluvial lands of louisiana and he recognized a network pattern of poorly developed drainage channels that was converted to a dendritic pattern as a rest of tilting and steepening of the gradient null figure 26 drainage pattern modified by uplift price and whetstone 1977 used asymmetric river and valley crosssection profiles as evidence for movement along the chattahoochee embayment in florida subsidence caused southward migration of eastwest flowing channels southflowing streams exhibit paired terraces while eastwest trending streams contain extensive terraces on ah northern side with few or no terraces on the steeper southern margin subsidence in the chattahoochee embayment and adjacent warping along the chattahoochee uplift resulted in asymmetrical incision along the chattahoochee river longcontinued tilting in a crossvalley diction will cause lateral erosion and the development of an asymmetrical valley and drainage network muehlberger 1979 noted this type of asymmetry in an area near taos new mexico figure 27 using 71minute us geological survey topographic 2 maps he described this asymmetry quantitatively by selecting a contour on the valley wall and measuring the distance from the stream to the contour in a downtilt direction dd and in the opposite uptilt direction du an index of asymmetry was developed dddu figure 27 the index for 30 small drainage basins was 06 indicating a major displacement of the main channel in a downtilt direction cox 1994 used a somewhat different index to demonstrate tilting and river shift in the southwestern mississippi embayment other indices of asymmetry are described by keller and pinter 1996 pp 126 127 null figure 27 map of asymmetrical stream valleys in the vicinity of taos new mexico showing method of measuring distances used in calculating index of asymmetry modified after muehlberger 1979 lake patterns lakes are temporary features in terms of geological time but they can be clear evidence of deformation they occur at various scales along primary or secondary portions of the drainage network and generally disappear as erosion and deposition occurs through time they may be isolated but the are more frequently clustered in a specific area or they are aligned along specific trends isolated lakes are generally due to local events such as landslides or collapses which form a dam but clustered lakes are due to regional processes which may be related to climate for paleoclimate neotectonic deformation or frequently a combination of these processes large lake may occupy geological basins and active tectonics is partly or totally involved in their formation such lakes act as drainage collectors and they can occupy various elevations the bolivian altiplano lake titicaca popoo uyuni stand at an elevation of around 4000 m and are associated with plate convergence and uplift continental stretching and transtensional tectonics are favorable for the formation of basins and tectonic lakes often the relation of lakes to faults is obvious and a study of the lake pattern is not necessary to demonstrate the effect of tectonics see chapter 5 where reelfoot lake and the mississippi valley sunklands are described figures 51 52 null figure 28 inferred fault zone aid the area of the tupinambaranas in the amazon basin between obidos and manaus brazil modified after sternberg 1955 the river trace and ria ages suggest a downward movement along the same axis as that of the inferred fault this discussion deals with cases where specific lake patterns ria lakes and elongated lakes are related to active deformation most 0 these concepts are not new for example the significance of ria lakes was identified more than 30 years ago ria lakes dendritic ria lakes occur at the lower bar of a tributary which is blocked by aggradation along the trunk river holz et al 1979 in the lower and central parts of the amazonian basin the formation of ria lakes is related to postglacial eustacy irion 1984 some of these lakes have a knee pattern superposed on the dendritic pattern suggesting the effect of active faulting through a thick sedimentary cover sternberg 1950 1955 figure 28 null figure 29 structural scheme of the marann basin in peru composed of the pastaza

south margin of the beni basin dumont 1992 dumont and guyot 1993 an elongated cluster of ria lakes is located along the lower pastaza river and the marann river in the western part of the marann basin

subandean thrust and fault belt stfb null figure 210 relative positions of tectonic lakes in the peruvian foreland basins stars indicate location of clusters of ria lakes modified after dumont 1996 the pastaza depression is filled by more than 4 500 m of cretaceous and cenozoic sediments with about 500 m of quaternary sediment laurent 1985 figure 29 no ria lakes are observed in the south part of the marann basin ucamara depression but ria lakes occur again in the ucayali basin of central peru figure 210 a piggyback basin a continental rift generates tilt of the side blocks in opposite directions and the progressive tilting of the earths surface can significantly modify the gradient of rivers for example lake victoria is drained by the victoria nile which flows north to lake kyoga figure 211 lake kyoga and lake kwania look artificial but they are not the result of dam construction they are n fact formed by uplift ad eastward tilting of western uganda flow in the kafu river has been reversed and water draining from lake victoria has found a new course to the north where it flows over murchison falls and into lake albert the geologically recent derangement of these drainage systems is the result of uplift that is apparently continuing at the present time doornkamp and temple 1966 null figure 211 lake kyoga region uganda arrows show flow directions in rivers back tilting explains the shape of lake kyoga and lake kwania modified after doornkamp and temple 1966 elongated lakes the term elongated lakes is applied t lakes that are long and narrow these lakes are superimposed over basement structures in subsiding basins they are also closely related to active tectonics the puinahua 1324 km2 and punga 34 km2 lakes are both located in the south art of the marann

lakes are also parallel to the strike of normal faulting with a nnwsse extension in the upland border dumont et al 1988 as a result the lakes are interpreted as the surface expression of tensional stress superimposed over reactivated basement structures due to the onset of andean tectonics dumont and garcia 1991 more precise morphological evidence of active tectonics comes from the punga lake according to testimony of old settlers and published travel journals stiglish 1904 the area was covered by forest that developed on a terrace before 1923 then the region began to subside the tree trunks of the drowned forest are still visible now below 2 m of water during low water stages in this very flat area the water level rises about 2 m during floods suggesting a minimum subsidence of 4 m over about 70 years a tectonic interpretation is favored because a local rise of bag level cannot be involved only a downward motion of isthe area where the lake s observed can explain the phenomenon these lakes are related to downdropped blocks that are related to a tensional system terraces the vertical warping of terraces as a result of deformation has been studied by numerous investigators machida 1960 zuchiewicz 1980 king and stein 1983 the offset of terraces by lateral faulting gives a clear indication of fault movement the offset terraces at the mouth of the waiohine gorge in new zealand shows the amount of displacement and the episodic nature of the displacement figure 212 in addition to river terraces the deformation of lake terraces and marine terraces keller and pinter 1996 are proof of isostatic and tectonic activity because they formed horizontally at a given water level an example is the isostatic deformation of the pleistocene lake bonneville shorelines hugh crittenden 1963 portions of the lake bonneville shorelines have been deformed as much as 210 feet as it drained and evaporated to form great salt lake in addition deformed marine terraces provide an excellent indication of recent deformation along 440 km of the pacific coast of baja california orme 1980 not only are terraces deformed but as an uplift is crossed a floodplain can be converted to a low terrace this will of course dramatically alter the hydraulics and hydrology of t reach in addition to the obvious evidence of deformation described above evidence of

pattern trend and gradient that cannot be attributed to other causes structural geologists and petroleum geologists have known for years at rivers are strong indicators of faulting lattman 1959 howard 1967 tectonic activity can significantly control river patterns and behavior and this is especially true of alluvial rivers neef 1966 and radulescu 1962 state that neotectonic movements can be reflected only in those geomorphic features that react to the smallest changes of slope such as meander characteristics an addition the variations of thickness and distribution of recent sediments indicate the variability of tectonics in a given valley clearly one of the most sensitive indicators of change is the valley floor profile and longitudinal profile of a stream bendefy et al 1967 zuchiewicz 1979 alluvial rivers will be very sensitive indicators of valley slope change in order to maintain a constant gradient a river that is being steepened by a downstream tilt will increase its sinuosity or braid whereas a reduction of valley slope ill lead co a reduction ef sinuosity or aggradation if the pattern cannot change for example twidale 1966 reported that boots the flinders and leichardt rivers have changed to a braided pattern as a result of the steepening of their gradient by the selwyn upwarp in northern queensland australia and the red river near winnipeg canada gis straightening as s result of reduction of gradient by isostatic rebound welch 1973 other examples are provided by the mississippi river between st louis and cairo and the lower missouri river adams 1980 as well as the red river of the nor near winnipeg canada vanicek and nagy 1980 baselevel changes can also resemble the effects of active tectonics and can provide information on channel change for example if sealevel is lowered and a steep portion of the continental shelf is exposed the effect will be like that downstream of the axis of an uplift lane 1955 argued that a lowering of baselevel will cause channel adjustment throughout most of the river indeed lanes 1955 argument that a stream wif restore its gradient at a higher or lower level following a baselevel change is conceptually correct because if the river is initially at grade then to move its sediment load and water discharge through the channel the original gradient of the stream must be reestablished however sediment loads may be greater after channel incision and less after aggradation another fallacy in lanes argument is the assumption that the valley slope and channel gradient are identical this is at the case and the twodimensional perspective leads to erroneous conclusions for example a sinuous river has a gradient less than that of the valley floor sinuosity p is the ratio between channel length l c aid valley length l v and it is also the ratio between valley slope s v and channel gradient s c as follows therefore a straight channel has a sinuosity of 10 and the gradient of the channel and the slope of the valley floor are the same it has been demonstrated that rivers can respond to major changes of water and sediment load primarily by pattern changes schumm 1968 and that much of the pattern variability of large alluvial rivers such as the mississippi indus and nile reflect the variability of the valley slope schumm et al 1994 jorgensen et al 1993 schumm and galay 1994 null figure 213 effect of a baselevel fall on channel length and pattern see text for discussion figure 213 illustrates this concept geometrically and it shows the impact of the lowering eg baselevel in a valley with a stream of sinuosity p 15 the line ac represents the channel profile and the line ab represents the profile of the valley floor points b and c are at the river mouth and points f and g are at the same location n the valley the channel distance is onethird longer than ah valley distance and the difference in channel and valley slope reflects the sinuosity of the stream the length of the channel is 15 times the length of the valley and therefore the stream gradient is onethird less than the valley slope equation 1 if a vertical fall of baselevel from b to d and c to e is assumed channel incision and lateral erosion will steepen the valley floor if the channel is not confined laterally it can adjust to the increased valley slope fd by increasing sinuosity to 20 and the channel profile is extended to h in this case incision ceases at point f in the valley and at point g in the channel because the increase of sinuosity from 15 to 0 from g to h maintains a constant channel gradient over the reach of increased valley slope fd the onethird increase of channel length sinuosity between g and h compensates for a onethird steepening of the valley floor from f to d according to lanes assumptions the effect 0 this baselevel fall would be propagated upstream to point a where an amount of erosion equal to bd would occur however because the stream can adjust the steepening 0 the valley floor will not result in 3a change of stream gradient rather the channel lengthens and the effect of baselevel lowering is propagated only a relatively short distance upstream the distance will undoubtedly depend on local conditions and the original slope of the valley floor but this exercise supports sauciers 1991 contention that pleistocene sea level change in the lower mississippi valley was effective only as far as baton rouge see also blum 1993 and blum and valastro 1994 the probability that 3a large river can adjust in this fashion is made more likely by the fact that the baselevel changes in nature will take place relatively slowly and not abruptly unlike during the experimental studies the river therefore has more time to adjust by changing sinuosity further evidence for the type of channel response shown in figure 213 is demonstrated by the experimental studies of jeff ware 1992 oral comm he lowered baselevel relatively slowly to a maximum of 12 cm in a flume with a total length of 184 e this change would have doubled the channel gradient however the effect of the baselevel lowering extended only 4 m upstream and the change in baselevel was accommodated by an increase of sinuosity from 12 to 15 in isthe lower 4 m in the flume it is clear however that pattern change did not totally compensate for the change of baselevel this channel widened and roughness increased thereby assuming part of the adjustment to the baselevel change wares experiments showed that a sinuosity increase which resulted in a slope decrease was only part of the adjustment and width depth and roughness adjusted to decrease velocity and stream power therefore channel pattern change may only absorb part of a valley slope or baselevel change the river nile provides an example of such shared adjustment with both sinuosity and width changing as valley slope changes schumm and galay 1994 changes of valleyfloor gradient provide an explanation of downstream pattern variations but variations of valleyfloor slope can be the result of several influences tectonic activity may change the slope of the valley floor and have its effect on the channel pattern adams 1980 in addition a highsedimenttransporting tributary may build a fanlike deposit in the valley which will persist even after the tributary sediment load has decreased when the main river crosses this fan pattern changes will result as the river attempts to maintain a constant gradient tributaries to the jordan river i israel have developed fanlike deposits in the valley and the valley floor of the jordan valley undulates as a result the jordan river as it approaches one of these convexities straightens as it crosses the upstream flatter part of the fan and then it develops a more sinuous course on the steeper downstream side of the fan schumm 1977 p 140 it is important to realize at channels that lie near a pattern threshold figure 23 may change their characteristics dramatically with only a slight change in the controlling variable for example some rivers that are meandering and that are near pattern thresholds become braided with only a small addition of bed load schumm 1939 experimental studies and field observations confirm that a change of valleyfloor slope will cause a change of channel morphology the change will differ however depending where the channel des on a plot such as at of figure 23 and depending on the type of chance figure 24 for example with increasing slope v straight channel will become sinuous a low sinuosity channel will become more sinuous and a meandering channel will braid with decreasing slope a braided channel will meander and a meandering channel will straighten null figure 214 reaches a degradation and aggradation associated with uplift and faulting although pattern changes may dominate river response deposition in reaches of reduced gradient is likely as is channel incision and bank erosion in reaches of steepened gradient figure 214 in fact upstream deposition wif reduce downstream sediment loads thereby increasing the tendency for downstream erosion therefore in addition to the primary valleyfloor deformation by active tectonics and the secondary channel response to this deformation there are thirdorder effects beyond the area of deformation for example deposition upstream from the axis of a dome can progress further upstream by backfilling beyond the area of active deformation figure 214 this means that the uplift is acting as a dam and unless erosion on the steeper downstream side of the uplift produces sufficient sediment to compensate erosion will occur downstream beyond the limits of deformation however it big more likely that reduced sediment load will accelerate erosion n the steeper downstream reach and when this increased load moves downstream aggradation will result figure 214 null figure 215 effect of change from weaker w to more resistant r materials on meander pattern another aspect of both active and neotectonics is the appearance of more resistant materials in the channel as the channel degrades resistant alluvium clay plugs gravel armor or bedrock will confine the channel and retard meander shift and bank erosion the result should be deformed or compressed meanders upstream and a change of meander character at the contact for example as meanders shift downvalley their movement may be retarded if more resistant alluvium or bedrock is encountered jin and schumm 1987 hence a fault may present a barrier with the result that upstream meanders are compressed and deformed figure 215 a similar pattern will result if the river encounters bedrock as it crosses an upwarp or ef as a result of incision it encounters resistant materials in a portion of its course yeromenko and ivanov 1977 reviewed de russian literature and concluded that for rivers crossing uplifts the largest number of meanders occur upstream of the structures which supports gardners 1975 observations if bedrock channels in the colorado plateau this is the reverse of what is expected for alluvial channels from the relation of figure 23 therefore an investigator must not simply base conclusions on river pattern alone discussion alluvium is usually assumed to hide the underlying geology but rates of active tectonic movement are sufficiently rapid to affect the morphology an behavior of alluvial rivers rivers being the most sensitive components of the landscape will provide evidence of even slow aseismic tectonic activity for example evidence of active tectonics is as follows 1 deformation of valley floor longitudinal profile 2 deformation of channel longitudinal profile 3 change of channel pattern 4 change of channel width and depth 5 conversion of floodplain to a low terrace t reaches of active channel incision or lateral shift 7 effects both upstream and downstream of the zone of deformation degradation aggradation flooding bank erosion 8 formation of lakes alluvial channels are sensitive indicators of change but they also adjust to changes of hydrology and sediment load as well as to active tectonics therefore it ma be difficult to determine the cause of channel change when in fact human activities have been changing both discharge and sediment load during historic time pattern change alone ill not sufficient evidence for active tectonics rather it is one bit of evidence that must be supported with other morphologic evidence andor surveys that provide clear evidence of deformation in many areas the evidence will be circumstantial nevertheless anomalous reaches that are not related to artificial controls tributary influences lithologic change 0 paleotectonics may reasonably be assumed to be the result of active tectonics until proved otherwise lakes can also provide information on subsidence and ria lakes can be evidence of tilting or even hydrologic and climatic influences for example during pleistocene aggradation in the ohio river and mississippi river valleys numerous lakes formed in tributary valleys therefore care must be exercised when determining the tectonic significance of lakes and other river anomalies
