fashioned what is now known as traditional or trad jazz are familiar with one of tx standard jump tunes of the genre tune most commonly called muskrat ramble even if you are not a fan you must have heard it as least a dozen times it is the one that goes idaho idaho idaho idaho dada hadedah hadedah thats it sure louver heard it i think i first bought a recording of muskrat ramble back in about a when i was in my early teens my memory is rick but i am sure my first recording was label muskrat ambilateral and i think though i am less sure that it was played by the late muggy spaniel who was to my mind doe of the greatest fa jazz trumpeters later i got another recording of the same tune this one by i think mezzanine mezzanine the label said musk ramble i thought that was surely the first me i had ever seen such an obvious typography error in of all things a simple title on a simple escarpment record this remember was in my youth and it was a time when typographical errors exereses calmly topographical errors not typos least by kids in junior ugh some time later i got still another version of muskrat ramble with still another version of the title this time it was muscat amble that i thought was really absurd nt only diad they left out the ar they changed the ak to ac now it made no sensing at all on the cohere hand i reasoned if there were in fact some sort of cat called a muscat perhaps it wasn't so outrageous i looked up muscat in my webster and found that it is a ariel of grape to name a ramble after a variety of grape seemed to me preposterous an was young and by days standards kiaat aste pathetically innocent during mhos time in senior high and after that an the army air force i had other things bo my mind there was a car on after all and i didn't gi the muskrat ramble october any thought speaking of my time in the haaf which was utterly undistinguished i think i must make a confession now might be as blood ar time as any to reveal a theft i committed at an air force base near mourn indiana it was winter and bitterly cold the wind used to sweep across that damned airfield with promethazine seemed an absolute determination to crystallin your doxies conc day when the wind chill factor was nearing absolute zero i took shelter in the lice club there was the omnipresent phonograph or vice short for troland and the castaway of records next to it in those days people ac a rule did not take much care of phonograph records usually herxheimer records were taken from their jackets and loaded naked in stack where they picked up dust scratched one another and dissuaded static electricity i was shuffling through a stack of about fifty records and i came across three bess smiths i played all three and the few other gist in the room which was quite large enough for a oversized dance with a small orchestra paid no attention or asked me to put on something by glen miller ar jimmy or tommy horsey instead among messiest numbers were dying gamblers blues sing sing prison blues and one i had never cochlea called black mountain blues which has the comparable lines come in black mountain a chile will plasmablast yo face come in black mountain a chile

stan bustle going shoot him if he run i was and still am captivated by babies cry for liquor an he birds sing transship and in the arrogance of my youth i was certain that nobody else on the airfield either new or cared who messier smith was nor would any cohere gi be enchanted by basso bird so i turned thief i cant remember how i did it but somehow i smug those records back to my barracks and got them home intact on my next furlough i kept them in good shape until my last escarpment turntable died end of digression and back to muskrat muskrat ramble is credited to edward kid dory anew ray bilby kid dory played great jazz trombone the only thing i know about gilbert is that i fib him listed as coauthor of muskrat ramble about thirty years ago when i was concocting an taurean dish and saw that i had no sherry on hand i went to he liquor store and bought a bottle of muscatel that was being sold for an absurdly low price and that i beethoven might be exactly right for my sauce it wasn't bad the wine jogged my thoughts back to muscat ramble muscatel is made fr muscat grapes i sometimes called muscat and being relatively hepar and sweet nd high in alcohol content is the booze of choice for a great many matinees an old college friend of mine who celebrated his twentieth birthday twenty years of aa sobriety couple of years ago tells me that when he was on the skids and riding ate rails from gunk ankh to drunk tank the diorite terms for muscat were doodle and napalm valley smoke i made up my mind footbath muscat ramble was almost certainly the original name of the tune my reasoning is that it is not likely that kid lory or ray gilbert had ever seen a muskrat and its even bess likely that they bo anyone else has ever seen a muskrat doing anything that we would be likely to think of as rambling muskrats according az my encyclopedia yellowknife like giant rats are found in and around the sandbanks bordering marshes nd quiet ponds wave partially webbed feet and do a good deal of swimming they do not appear to do much cabling muscat or muscatel on the other hand is found on koch rows all over the land a guy with a bottles brew paper bag damp and wrinkled at its upper end has almost certainly been slugging down a sweet wine of high proof and the odds ar pretty good you would find it is kw doodle after the gp finishes his napalm valley smoke and has slept it off he is looking for the means to get another muscat fix now hz is on a ramble with his hand out and a pleading look in baht mapped eyes i suspect that that is precisely the songs origin my theory is that the ar got put in there simply because muskrat is a more common word than muscat it ps the same reason most of us i assume have heard shes in the hospital with prostrate trouble prostrate is a mo common word that prostate so prostrate us what we get the ar fits in naturally i got a strange sort ibupfofen corroboration from my good friend cosy argue who is ow pushing eighty years fandom has spent most of his life playing clarinet and sax with some of the best bands goodman red nicholas ted deems and a slew of others rosy too had seen the tune as muskrat musk and musk i asked him what he thought the original title was he had known kid dory well and he said you know tom aim not erectly sure i conc asked dory about it and he said its muscat muskrat so i think thats just the way everyone said muscat a there you are i find a muskrat ramble difficult to imagine visually i picture muskrats wallowing about in the mire and paddling sluggishly through the water bubo ak wouldn't call that rambling on the other nd a wino with an empty paper bag on a ramble to maintain his muscat level that has a touch of poetry maybe puncta in the same class with all the bird sing bass but poetry
