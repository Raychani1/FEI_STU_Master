deformation and river response before specific examples of syntectic impacts on alluvial rivers can be discussed i brief review of types of tectonic activity types of rivers and river response will be presented this background material sets the stage for detailed discussions that follow types of deformation the surgical movements in an alluvial valley can take different forms fs illustrated in figure i the displacement can be seismic and associated kith earthquakes and abrupt faulting or it can be aseismic with progressive tilting and warping of the valley floor faults may i lateral faults that displace or offset the channel figure na without vertical displacement this type of displacement should be easily recognizee faults with vertical displacement may have tt uplifted block upstream of the fault with the result that gradient is steepened figure cb in the opposite case the gradient will be decreased figure ac the effect will resemble monoclinic tilting figure ff i pairs of faults may produce uplifted horst or dropped blocks graben that will both steepen and reduce gradient figure ad i this has the same effect as domes and anticlines or basins and syncline figure ah i in addition to all of these structural features the entire valley may be tilted upstream or downstream or the tilting may be across the valley toward either side of the floodplain figure dj i i the possibilities are great but in reality the result will be local steepening or reduction of gradient or crossable tilting streams respond to vertical displacement along faults figure cb and i by aggradation or degradation when the displacement produces i channel segment steeper than the original stream gradient figure cb erosion will be initiated in this reach when the displacement produces i channel segment of lower elevation or gradient than the original stream figure ac aggradation will occur even all displacements may be sufficient i induce aggradation or degradation i large streams if the displacement forms i dam figure ac the stream will be blocked and it will flow along the fault or form i lake alsace a mentioned that even i few inches of vertical upthrow along the downstream sice of i fault can produce i dam across i small stream which can divert its course bull figure i surface deformation by faulting folding and lateral tilting plan view on left prosection on right from ouch a small arrows indicate direction of flow large arrows indicate direction of movement the displacement in each case is greatly exaggerated horst and raven figure ad and be combine two different types be vertical displacement figure cb and i there will be aggradation upstream from the horst and degradation which will migrate upstream on the downstream part of the horst reduced sediment supply because of aggradation upstream will enhance the downstream degradation upstream of the graben there will be degradation an aggradation in taj grain itself i river in such i location will be unstable as artier pand alt a suggested for the bitterest river in montana the type of folding figure i will affect i river similar to the various types of faulting but changes will probably be less abrupt the effects of tilting will depend upon the amount but in the simplest as steepening of i valley will cause degradation figure ak and i reverse tilt figure al will cause deposition lateral tilting will cause channel shift downed figure dj or avulsion figure ac shows only simple but exaggerated cases whereas actual displacements can be more complicated for example faults can take any angle from parallel to perpendicular to river flow direction fault displacements of the surface at the time of an earthquake are obvious and its influence on alluvial rivers can be observed for example small stream channels have been offset by strikes movement figures i aa of the san andes fault alsace a pointed out that the offset of i stream channel depends on the relative rates of fluvial and tectonic processes the main reason why channel offset caused by the san andes fault is clear is the extremely high rate of displacement along the fault i year brown and alsace a and the relatively small size of streams crossing and flowing along the fault while fault displacements are obvious movements i the land surface by folding can be slow however this type of deformation can also be an important influence on river behaving for example concentration of erosion log only one river bank can be the result of lateral tilt jefferson a manson a feeder and alexander ar types of alluvial rivers it is apparent that different types of alluvial channels will respond differently ko deformation therefore their characteristics must be reviewed before their response can ba valuated this can est i done by discussing i simple classification of alluvial channels that is based on type of sediment load and pattern five basic channel patterns exist figure i i straight channels with either migrating sand waves or i with migrating alternate bars forming i sinuous thalweg i two types of meandering channels i highly sinuous channel of equal width patten aa and channels that are wide at bends than in crossings pattern cb i the meandering transition and i i typical braided stream the relative stability of these channels in terms of their normal erosional activity and the shape and gradient of the channels as related to relative sediment size load velocity of flow and stream power are also indicated in figure i it has been possible to develop these patterns experimentally by varying he gradient sediment load stream power and the type of sediment load transported by the channel chum and kahn a therefore alluvial channels have also been classified according to the type of sediment load moving through the channels as suspended mixed and bedlam channels figure i water discharge determines the dimensions of the channel width depth meander dimensions but the relative proportions of bed load sand and gravel and suspended load silts and clays determine not only the shade of the channel but widthes ratio and channel pattern i suspended channel has been defined as one that transports less than i percent bed load and i bedlam channel as one transporting more than i percent bed load chum a the mixed channel lies between these two figure yd null figure ca channel classification based on pattern and type of sediment load with associated variables and relative stability indicated chum a alluvial rivers that transport clay silt sand and gravel can be placed within these three general categories however within the mainstream group there is considerable range of sinuosity i to i in addition in the airstream category there are abraded and slandered channels islands are vegetated bars figure i suggests that the range of channels from straight to braided forms i continuum but experimental work nd field studies he indicated that the changes of pattern between braided meandering and straight occur relatively abruptly at overmatter thresholds figure i the pattern changes take place at critical values of stream power gradient and sediment load chum and kahn a null figure i relation between flume slope and sinuosity during experiments at constant water discharge sediment load stream power velocity increase with flume slope and i similar relation can be developed with these variables from chum and khan a although the five patterns of figure i involve all three river types there are five basic bedlam channel patterns figure aa that have been recognizee during experimental studies of channel patterns chum a i i these five basic bello channel patterns can be extended to nielloed and suspended channels to produce i river patterns figure i patterns i are bedlam channel patterns patterns i are mixed channel patterns and patterns a are suspended channel patterns figure i attempts to shaw sinuosity differences and how the pattern thresholds change wt increasing valley slope stream power and sediment load for each channel type the three major river types are controlled by type of sediment load but within each type the different patterns reflect increased valley slope sediment load and stream power the different bedlam channel patterns figure od can be described as follows pattern i straight essentially equality channel with migrating sand waves pattern i alternate channel with migrating side i alternate bars and i slightly sinuous thalweg pattern i sinuosity meandering channel with large alternate bars that develop chutes pattern i transitional meanderingly braided channel the large alternate bars or point bars have been dissected by chutes but i meandering thalweg can be identified pattern i is i typical abraded channel as compared to the bedlam channels the five mixed channels figure cb are relatively narrower and deeper and there is greater ban stability the higher degree of bank stability permits the maintenance of narrow deep straight channels pattern i and alternate bars stabile because of the finer sediments to form slightly sinuous channels pattern i pattern i is i truly meandering channel wide on the bends relatively narrow at the crossings and subject i chute cutoffs pattern i maintains the sinuosity of i meandering channel but with i greater sediment transport the presence of bars gives it i composite upbraided appearance pattern i is i braided channel that is relatively more stable than that of bedlam channel i and it is likely to ba slandered null figure i the range of alluvial channel patterns for the three channel types i bedlam channel patterns i mixed channel patterns i suspended channel patterns from chum a suspended channels figure ac are narrow and deeper than mixed channels suspended load pattern i is i straight narrow deep channel with only small quantities of bed load this type i channel may have the highest sinuosity of all patterns i and i rivers may undergo i metamorphosis during which the channel morphology changes completely that is i suspended channel pattern i could become braided pattern i oar i braided channel pattern i could become meandering pattern i or i etc when there is i sufficiently great change in the type of sediment load transported through that channel therefore the change from one type of channel pattern to another may be relatively common as the nature of the sediment moved through the system changes and this may be the effect of tributary sediment contributions or upstream degradation or aggradation or tectonics there is an additional channel pattern that spans the range of stream types of figure i this is the anastomosing pattern of branching and rejoining channel segments chum et al a the channel segments can be straight meandering or braided and they appear to span he range of channel types anastomosing or anabranch channels differ from braided channels because they are composed of multiple channels that are separated by i floodplain fire i whereas braided channels have multiple thalweg in i single channel knight and anon a and richards et al a suggest that is pattern is transitioned to i single channel bemuse anastomosing rivers appear to be associated with partly blocked valleys smith and smith a and tectonic uplift gregory and chum a reduced gradient from whatever cause appears to be important and therefore anastomosing reaches of i river can be evidence of tectonic activity evidence of deformation the first geomorphic clues of active tectonics may be tectonic landform that result from continued deformation such as modified drainage networks and deformed sets of terraces these obvious features are in contrast to the more subtle changes of alluvial rivers drainage networks the arrangement of streams and tributaries into i drainage network is affected by the regional slope of the surface on which the pattern develops climate and the edibility of the surface material local variations in both slope and materials will cause variations in the drainage pattern figure i for example experimental studies demonstrated that parallel drainage patterns form on slopes greater than about i percent whereas dendritic patterns form on gentler slopes phillips and chum a null figure i map of anastomosing channels of ovens and king rivers numbers indicate relative ages of channels and reaches of channels from youngest i to oldest i from chum et al a local variations in regional surface slope can cause anomalous drainage patterns i topographic high caused by active uplift will cause i deflection of portions of the drainage pattern for instance on the slope side of an uplift the local surface slope will be opposite that of the regional slope this can cause portions of the drainage patten to develop in i direction opposite to that of the drainage network an uplift may also deflect portions of the drainage from the general direction of the regional slope figure i as the major streams are deflected away from the uplift tributaries on one side will be lengthened and those on the other side will be shortened changes of an entire drainage network as na result of tilting are described by sparling a who notes that isostatic adjustment in ottawa county ohio has increased the gradient of some streams and decreased the gradient of others incision of the steepened streams permitted them to capture the streams that were aggrading as i result of reduced gradient russell a described various drainage patens found an the flat eluvial lands of louisiana and he recognizee i network pattern of poorly developed drainage channels that was converted to i dendritic pattern as i rest of tilting and steepening of the gradient null figure i drainage pattern modified by uplift price and whetstone a used asymmetric river and valley prosection profiles as evidence for movement along the chattanooga embayment in florida subsidence caused southward migration of easiest flowing channels outflown streams exhibit paired terraces while easiest trending streams contain extensive terraces on ah northern side with few or no terraces on the steeper southern margin subsidence in the chattanooga embayment and adjacent warping along the chattanooga uplift resulted in asymmetrical incision along the chattanooga river continued tilting in i crossable diction will cause lateral erosion and the development of an asymmetrical valley and drainage network merger a noted this type of asymmetry in an area near tao new mexico figure i using minute us geological survey topographic i maps he described this asymmetry quantitatively by selecting i contour on the valley wall and measuring the distance from the stream to ohs contour in i downhill direction ad and in the opposite uptilt direction du an index of asymmetry was developed du figure i the index for i small drainage basins was i indicating i major displacement of the main channel in i downhill direction co a used i somewhat different index to demonstrate tilting and river shift in the southwestern mississippi embayment other indices of asymmetry are described by feller and inter a pp i i null figure i map of asymmetrical stream valleys in the vicinity of tao new mexico showing method of measuring distances used in calculating index of asymmetry modified after merger a lake patterns lakes are temporary features in terms of geological time but they can be clear evidence of deformation they occur at various scales along primary or secondary portions of the drainage network and generally disappear as erosion and deposition occurs through time they may be isolated but the are more frequently clustered in i specific area or they are aligned along specific trends isolated lakes are generally due to local events such as landslides or collapses which form i dam but clustered lakes are due to regional processes which may be related to climate ko macroclimate geotectonic deformation or frequently i combination of these processes large lake may occur geological basins and active tectonics is partly or totally involved in their formation such lakes act as drainage collectors and they can occupy various elevations the bolivian allan las titivate pop zuni stand at an elevation of around a i and are associated with plate convergence and uplift continental stretching and transfusional tectonics are coverable for the formation of basins and tectonic lakes often the relation of lakes to faults is obvious and i study of the lake pattern is not necessary to demonstrate the effect of tectonics

side blocks in opposite directions and the progressive tilting of the earths surface can significantly modify the gradient of rivers for example lake victoria is drained by the victoria nile which

in the ar river has been reversed and water draining from lake victoria has found i new course to the north where it flows over urchin falls and into lake albert the geologically recent derangement of these drainage systems is the result of uplift that is apparently continuing at the present time doorjamb and temple a null figure i lake yoga region uganda arrows show flow directions in rivers back tilting explains the shape of lake yoga and lake crania modified after doorjamb and temple a elongated lakes the term elongated lakes is applied i lakes that are long and narrow these lakes are

offset of terraces by lateral faulting gives i clear indication of fault movement the offset terraces at the mouth of the wahine gorge in new zealand shows the amount of displacement and the episodic

california ore a not only are terraces deformed but as an uplift is crossed i floodplain can be inverted to i low terrace this will of course dramatically alter the hydraulics and hydrology of i reach in addition to the obvious evidence of deformation described above evidence of deformation is provided by alluvial deposits and paleozoic machete a feller et al a bull a rockfall et al a rockfall a by

dramatic changes of pattern trend and gradient that cannot be attributed to other causes structural geologists and petroleum geologists have koan for years tat rivers are strong indicators of faulting lama a hoard a tectonic activity can significantly control river patterns and behaving and this is especially true of alluvial rivers beef a and rules a state that geotectonic movements can be reflected only in those geomorphic features that react to the smallest changes of slope such as meander characteristics an addition the variations of thickness and distribution of recent sediments indicate the variability of tectonics in i given valley clearly one of the most sensitive indicators of change is the valley floor profile and longitudinal profile of i stream beefy et al a chinch a alluvial rivers will be very sensitive indicators of valley slope change in order to maintain i constant gradient i river that is being steepened by i downstream tilt will increase its sinuosity or braid whereas i reduction of valley slope ill lead co i reduction nf sinuosity or aggradation if the pattern cannot change for example twiddle a reported that booth the flinders and echard rivers have changed to i braided pattern as i result of the steepening of their gradient by the sewn upward in northern queensland australia and the red river near winnipeg canada is straightening as i result of reduction of gradient by isostatic rebound welch a other examples are provided by the mississippi river between st louis and cairo and the lower missouri river adams a as well as the red river of the nor near winnipeg canada panick and nag a baseless changes can also resemble the effects of active tectonics and can provide information on channel change for example if sealevel is lowered and i steep portion of the continental shelf is exposed the effect will be like that downstream of the axis of an uplift lane a argued that i lowering of baseless will cause channel adjustment throughout most of the river indeed lanes a argument that i stream il restore its gradient at i higher or lower level following i baseless change is conceptually correct because if the river is initially at grade then to move its sediment load and water discharge through the channel the original gradient of the stream must be reestablished however sediment loads may be greater after channel incision and less after aggradation another fallacy in lanes argument is the assumption that the valley sloe and channel gradient are identical this is at the case and the dimensional perspective leads to erroneous conclusions for example i sinuous river has i gradient less than that of the valley floor sinuosity i is tee ratio between channel length i i aid valley length i i and it is also the ratio between valley slope i i and channel gradient i i as follows therefore i straight channel has i sinuosity of i and the gradient of the channel and the slope of the valley floor are the same it has been demonstrated that rivers can respond to major changes of water and sediment load primarily by pattern changes chum a and that much of the pattern variability of large alluvial rivers such as the mississippi indus and nile reflect the variability of the valley slope chum et al a ginsen et al a chum and gala a null figure i effect of i baseless fall on channel length and pattern see text for discussion figure i illustrates this concept geometrically and it shows the impact of the lowering ag baseless in i valley with i stream of sinuosity i i the line ac represents the channel profile and the line aa represents the profile of the valley floor points i and i are at the river mouth and points i and i are at the same location i the valley the channel distance is third longer than ah valley distance and the difference in channel and valley slope reflects the sinuosity of the stream the length of the channel is i times the length of the valley and therefore the stream gradient is third less than the valley slope equation i if i vertical fall of baseless from i to i and i to i is assumed channel incision and lateral erosion will steepen the valley floor if the channel is not confined laterally it can adjust to the increased valley slope fd by increasing sinuosity to i and the channel profile is expended to i in this case incision ceases at point i in the valley bd at point i in the channel because the increase of sinuosity from i to i from i to i maintains i constant channel gradient over the reach of increased valley slope fd the third increase of channel length sinuosity between i and i compensates for i third steepening of the valley floor from i to i according to lanes assumptions the effect i this baseless fall would be propagated upstream to point i where an amount of erosion equal to bd would occur however because the stream can adjust the steepening i the valley floor will not result in na change of stream gradin rather the channel lengthens and the effect nf baseless lowering is propagated only i relatively short distance upstream the distance will undoubtedly depend on local conditions and the original slope of the valley floor but this exercise supports saucers a contention that pleistocene sea level change in the lower mississippi valley was effective only as far as baton rouge see also bum a and bum and alar a the probability that da large river can adjust in this fashion is made more likely by the fact that the baseless changes in nature will take place relatively slowly and not abruptly unlike during the experimental studies the river therefore has more time to adjust by changing sinuosity further evidence for the type of channel response shown in figure i is demonstrated by the experimental studies of jiff ware a oral comm he lowered baseless relatively slowly to i maximum of i cm in i flume with i total length of i i this change would have doubled the channel gradient however the effect of the baseless lowering extended only i i upstream and the change in baseless was accommodated by an increase of sinuosity from i to i in she lower i i in the flume it is clear however that pattern change did not totally compensate for the change of baseless this channel widened and roughness increased thereby assuming part of the adjustment to the baseless change wares experiments showed that i sinuosity increase which resulted in i slop decrease was only part of the adjustment and width depth and roughness adjusted to decrease velocity and stream power therefore channel pattern change may only absorb part of i valley slope or baseless change the river nile provides an example of such shared adjustment with both sinuosity and width changing ap valley slope changes chum and gala a changes of valley gradient provide an explanation of downstream pattern variations but variations of valley slope can be the result of several influences tectonic activity may change the slope of the valley floor and have its effect on the channel pattern adams a in addition i transporting tributary may build i fatlike deposit in the valley which will persist even after the tributary sediment load has decreased when the main river crosses this fan pattern changes will result as the river attempts to maintain i constant gradient tributaries to the jordan river i israel have developed fatlike deposits in the valley and the valley floor of the jordan valley undulates as i result the jordan river as it approaches one of these convexities straightens as it crosses the upstream flatter part of the fan and then it develops i more sinuous course ko the steeper downstream side of the fan chum a i i it is important to realia hat channels that lie near i pattern threshold figure i may change their characteristics dramatically with only i slight change in the controlling variable for example some rivers that are meandering and that are near patten thresholds become braided with only i small addition of bed load chum i experimental studies and field observations confirm that i change of valley slope will cause i change of channel morphology the change will defer however depending where the channel es on i plot such as hat of figure i and depending on the type of thane figure i for example with increasing slope i straight cannel will become sinuous i low sinuosity channel will become more sinuous and i meandering channel will braid with decreasing slope i braided channel wail meander and i meandering channel will straighten null figure i reaches aa degradation and aggradation associated with uplift and caulking although pattern changes may dominate river response deposition in reaches of reduced gradient is likely as is channel incision and bank erosion in reaches of steepened gradient figure i in fact upstream deposition il reduce downstream sediment loads thereby incasing the tendency for downstream erosion therefore in addition to the primary valley deformation by active tectonics and the secondary channel response to this deformation there are reorder effects beyond the area of deformation for example deposition upstream from the axis of i dome can progress further upstream by backfilling beyond the area of active deformation figure i this means that the uplift is acting as i dam and unless erosion on the steeper downstream side of the uplift produces sufficient sediment to compensate erosion will occur downstream beyond the limits of deformation however it i more likely that reduced sediment load will accelerate erosion i the steeper downstream reach and when this increased load moves downstream aggradation will result figure i null figure i effect of change from weaker i to more resistant i materials on meander pattern another aspect of both active and geotectonic is the appearance of more resistant materials in the channel as the channel degrades resistant alluvium clay plugs gravel armer or bedrock will confine the channel and retard meander shit and bank erosion the result should be deformed or compressed meanders upstream and i change of meander character at the contact for example as meanders shift downfallen their movement may be retarded if more resistant alluvium or bedrock is encountered in and chum a hence i fault may present i barrier with the result that upstream meanders are compressed and deformed figure i i similar pattern will result if the river encounters bedrock as it crosses an upward or ff as i result of incision it encounters resistant materials in i portion of its course yeomen and nov a reviewed de russian literature and concluded that for rivers crossing uplifts the largest number of meanders cur upstream of the structures which supports garners a observations if bedrock channels in the colorado plateau this is the reverse of what is expected for alluvial channels from the relation of figure i therefore an investigator must not simply base conclusions on river pattern alone discussion alluvium is usually assumed to hide the underlying geology but rates of active tectonic movement are sufficiently rapid to affect the morphology an behaving of alluvial rivers rivers being the most sensitive components of the landscape will provide evidence of even slow aseismic tectonic activity for example evidence of active tectonics is as follows i deformation of valley flor longitudinal profile i deformation of channel longitudinal profile i change of channel pattern i change of channel width and depth i conversion of floodplain to i low terrace i reaches of active channel incision or lateral shift i effects both upstream and downstream of the zone of deformation degradation aggradation flooding bank erosion i formation of lakes alluvial channels are sensitive indicators of change but they also adjust to changes of hydrology and sediment load as well as to active tectonics therefore it ma be difficult to determine the cause of channel change when in fact human activities have been changing both discharge and sediment load during historic time pattern change alone il not sufficient evidence for active tectonics rather it is one bit of evidence that must be supported with other morphologic evidence pandor surveys that provide clear evidence of deformation in many areas the evidence will be circumstantial nevertheless anomalous reaches that are not related to artificial controls tributary influences lithologic change i geotectonic may reasonably be assumed to be the result of active tectonics until proved otherwise lakes can also provide information on subsidence and ia lakes can be evidence of tilting or even hydrologic and climatic influences for example during pleistocene aggradation in the ohio river and mississippi river valleys numerous lakes formed in tributary valleys therefore care must be exercised when determining the tectonic significance of lakes and other river anomalies
